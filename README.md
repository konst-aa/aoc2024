## Advent of Code 2024

I'm using python and haskell this year. Maybe some prolog

I made it to around day 10. I hope to finish this later in 2025, but just in python

For Haskell, some solutions rely on the following libraries:
- The hidden package [containers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers)
- The hidden package [array](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-0.5.8.0)
- [Text.Regex](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-compat-0.95.2.1/docs/Text-Regex.html)

`./day.sh DAY` or `./all-days.sh`
