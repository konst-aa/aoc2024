## Advent of Code 2024

I'm using python and haskell this year. Maybe some prolog.

For Haskell, I am using the following libraries for some of the problems:
- The hidden package [containers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers)
- [Text.Regex](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-compat-0.95.2.1/docs/Text-Regex.html)

`./day.sh DAY` or `./all-days.sh`
